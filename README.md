A "once posted, can't be deleted" blogging platform

## Description

Based on Blogger's post-by-email feature, by posting articles via a secret address and discarding the Blogger (i.e. Google) password, it is possible to create a blog where articles cannot be deleted once posted.

I am atelophobic and find myself editing articles over and over again, or wanting to delete them later, making it impossible to build up many articles.  This is why I need such a blogging system.
